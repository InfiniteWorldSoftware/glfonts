# glfonts
glfonts is a minimalist font renderer intended for "embedded" applications such as status bars and terminal emulators.
### Goals
- Be concise and readable
- Be extensible
- Draw fonts with potentially multiple faces to a part of the screen
- 32 bits of color in RGBA format
### Non-goals
- Antialiasing and subpixel rendering, though this may change in the future
- Fontconfig and XLFD support
